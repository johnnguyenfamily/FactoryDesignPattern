# Factory Pattern

In this sample code, I'll demonstrate how to use the Factory pattern, which is one of the most used design patterns in Java. The objective of the Factory pattern is to create object without exposing the creation logic to the client and refer to newly created object using a common interface.

# Use Case

Your company wants you to create a Report application where it can be used to generate a bunch of different report types such as Order report, Inventory report, Account Payable report, Account Receivable report, etc.

# Solution

As a professional developer, it always good to build your solution base on some existing Java design patterns. For this particular use case, Factory pattern is a perfect design pattern to be applied. I use Astah (a UML tool) to create the UML diagram to solve this specific problem.
